# DSC-640-Aviation-Safety-Project

  This project displays a current look into the status of international commerical aviation safety. The main purpose of this project is to compare commerical aviation safety with that of other forms of travel such as vehicle/road safety. 
  
  With the use of Tableau, Excel, and Python I have created a compelling arguement as why commercial aviation is the safest form of travel specifically in the United States, but also globally. This project initially had intent to apply data science methodology but qucikly found this was not necessary and only required an analysis to convey the evidence. There was no need for modeling due to the requirements of the project.
  
  The most important files here are the PowerPoint presentation and the Tableau workbook. Both files will convey the overall finding of the analysis but most importantly show Tableau capabilities and overall presention styling and delivery methodology.
